// Now figure out how you will use API return to put pins on the map of each restaurant

// NOTES
// =======================================================
//
// 1) Leaflet uses methods like jQuery. For example '.addTo' as well as '.setView' etc.
// a) openOn handles automatic closing of a previously opened popup when opening a new one. This would be good for our user
//
// 2) Every time something happens in Leaflet, e.g. user clicks on a marker or map zoom changes, 
//    the corresponding object sends an event which you can subscribe to with a function. It allows you to react to user interaction:
